1
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:10,157
The victory of the underdog over
the favored team.

2
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:13,490
The last minute penalty shot
that wins the tournament.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,334
The high-energy training montages.

4
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:19,749
Many people love to glorify victory
on the playing field,

5
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:21,118
cheer for favorite teams,

6
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:22,771
and play sports.

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:26,903
But here's a question:
Should we be so obsessed with sports?

8
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:30,495
Is playing sports actually as good for us
as we make it out to be,

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,834
or just a fun and entertaining pastime?

10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,464
What does science have to say?

11
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:40,561
First of all, it's well accepted that
exercise is good for our bodies and minds,

12
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,427
and that's definitely true.

13
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:46,522
Exercising, especially when we're young,
has all sorts of health benefits,

14
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,150
like strengthening our bones,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,997
clearing out bad cholesterol
from our arteries,

16
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:55,772
and decreasing the risk of stroke,
high blood pressure, and diabetes.

17
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:58,868
Our brains also release a number
of chemicals when we workout,

18
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:00,928
including endorphins.

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,149
These natural hormones,

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,903
which control pain and pleasure responses
in the cental nervous system,

21
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:10,771
can lead to feelings of euphoria,
or, what's often called, a runner's high.

22
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,180
Increased endorphins and consistent
physical activity in general

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,240
can sharpen your focus
and improve your mood and memory.

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,047
So does that mean we get just as much
benefit going to the gym five days a week

25
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:24,812
as we would joining a team and competing?

26
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:27,710
Well, here's where it gets interesting:

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,000
because it turns out that if you can find
a sport and a team you like,

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,371
studies show that there are all sorts
of benefits

29
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:38,639
that go beyond the physical
and mental benefits of exercise alone.

30
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:41,680
Some of the most significant
are psychological benefits,

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,085
both in the short and long term.

32
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:47,900
Some of those come from the communal
experience of being on a team,

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,555
for instance, learning to trust
and depend on others,

34
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,118
to accept help,

35
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,242
to give help,

36
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:56,804
and to work together towards
a common goal.

37
00:01:56,804 --> 00:02:00,242
In addition, commitment to a team
and doing something fun

38
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:04,587
can also make it easier to establish
a regular habit of exercise.

39
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:07,620
School sport participation 
has also been shown

40
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,964
to reduce the risk of suffering
from depression for up to four years.

41
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:16,210
Meanwhile, your self-esteem and confidence
can get a big boost.

42
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,846
There are a few reasons for that.

43
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,489
One is found in training.

44
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,379
Just by working and working at skills,

45
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,130
especially with a good coach,

46
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,592
you reinforce a growth mindset 
within yourself.

47
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:30,492
That's when you say, "Even if I can't
do something today,

48
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,903
I can improve myself through practice
and achieve it eventually."

49
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:38,252
That mindset is useful 
in all walks of life.

50
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,336
And then there's learning through failure,

51
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:44,926
one of the most transformative,
long-term benefits of playing sports.

52
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:48,402
The experience of coming to terms
with defeat can build the resilience

53
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,217
and self-awareness necessary 
to manage academic,

54
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,256
social,

55
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,780
and physical hurdles.

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,575
So even if your team isn't winning
all the time, or at all,

57
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:59,125
there's a real benefit to your experience.

58
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,934
Now, not everyone will enjoy every sport.

59
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,240
Perhaps one team is too competitive,

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,256
or not competitive enough.

61
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:09,430
It can also take time to find
a sport that plays to your strengths.

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,449
That's completely okay.

63
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,120
But if you spend some time looking,

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,068
you'll be able to find a sport
that fits your individual needs,

65
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,000
and if you do, there are so many benefits.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,409
You'll be a part of 
a supportive community,

67
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,129
you'll be building your confidence,

68
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,026
you'll be exercising your body,

69
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,962
and you'll be nurturing your mind,

70
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,183
not to mention having fun.
