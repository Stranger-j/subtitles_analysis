1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,800
15th century Europeans believed 
they had hit upon a miracle cure:

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,746
a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, 
bruising, nausea,

3
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:17,783
and virtually any other 
medical ailment.

4
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:21,609
This brown powder could be mixed 
into drinks, made into salves

5
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,502
or eaten straight up.

6
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:29,152
It was known as mumia and made 
by grinding up mummified human flesh.

7
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:32,761
The word "cannibal" dates from the 
time of Christopher Columbus;

8
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:36,108
in fact, Columbus may even have 
coined it himself.

9
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:39,097
After coming ashore on the 
island of Guadaloupe,

10
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:42,082
Columbus' initial reports back 
to the Queen of Spain

11
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:45,814
described the indigenous people as 
friendly and peaceful—

12
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:49,738
though he did mention rumors of a 
group called the Caribs,

13
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,006
who made violent raids and then cooked 
and ate their prisoners.

14
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:58,377
In response, Queen Isabella granted 
permission to capture and enslave

15
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,924
anyone who ate human flesh.

16
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:04,707
When the island failed to produce the gold
Columbus was looking for,

17
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:10,947
he began to label anyone who resisted his 
plundering and kidnapping as a Caribe.

18
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:17,012
Somewhere along the way, the word "Carib" 
became "Canibe" and then "Cannibal."

19
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:20,894
First used by colonizers to dehumanize 
indigenous people,

20
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:25,027
it has since been applied to anyone 
who eats human flesh.

21
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:29,067
So the term comes from an account that 
wasn't based on hard evidence,

22
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:33,561
but cannibalism does have a real and 
much more complex history.

23
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,201
It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, 
as with mumia,

24
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,706
it doesn't involved recognizable parts 
of the human body.

25
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:44,376
The reasons for cannibalistic practices 
have varied, too.

26
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:49,066
Across cultures and time periods, there's 
evidence of survival cannibalism,

27
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:53,464
when people living through a famine, 
siege or ill-fated expedition

28
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:57,964
had to either eat the bodies of the dead 
or starve to death themselves.

29
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,500
But it's also been quite common 
for cultures

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,410
to normalize some form of eating human 
flesh under ordinary circumstances.

31
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,837
Because of false accounts 
like Columbus's,

32
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:12,557
it's difficult to say exactly how common 
cultural cannibalism has been—

33
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:16,401
but there are still some examples of 
accepted cannibalistic practices

34
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,104
from within the cultures practicing them.

35
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:22,764
Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe 
during Columbus's time.

36
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:26,779
Starting in the 15th century, the demand 
for mumia increased.

37
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:31,049
At first, stolen mummies from Egypt 
supplied the mumia craze,

38
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,679
but soon the demand was too great to be 
sustained on Egyptian mummies alone,

39
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:41,766
and opportunists stole bodies from 
European cemeteries to turn into mumia.

40
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:44,578
Use of mumia continued for 
hundreds of years.

41
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,773
It was listed in the Merck index, 
a popular medical encyclopedia,

42
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,963
into the 20th century.

43
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:55,227
And ground up mummies were far from 
the only remedy made from human flesh

44
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:57,373
that was common throughout Europe.

45
00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:02,003
Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, 
was used to treat epilepsy,

46
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:06,552
while human liver, gall stones, oil 
distilled from human brains,

47
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:10,789
and pulverized hearts were popular 
medical concoctions.

48
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:11,580
In China,

49
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,760
the written record of socially accepted 
cannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years.

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,496
One particularly common 
form of cannibalism

51
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:22,324
appears to have been filial cannibalism,

52
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:26,276
where adult sons and daughters would 
offer a piece of their own flesh

53
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:27,472
to their parents.

54
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:32,082
This was typically offered as a last-ditch
attempt to cure a sick parent,

55
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:34,274
and wasn't fatal to their offspring—

56
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:39,147
it usually involved flesh from the thigh 
or, less often, a finger.

57
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:44,307
Cannibalistic funerary rites are another 
form of culturally sanctioned cannibalism.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,840
Perhaps the best-known example came 
from the Fore people of New Guinea.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,140
Through the mid-20th century, members 
of the community would,

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,366
if possible, make their funerary 
preferences known in advance,

61
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:02,236
sometimes requesting that family members
gather to consume the body after death.

62
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:05,464
Tragically, though these rituals 
honored the deceased,

63
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:10,574
they also spread a deadly disease known 
as kuru through the community.

64
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:14,262
Between the fictionalized stories, 
verifiable practices,

65
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:17,358
and big gaps that still exist 
in our knowledge,

66
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,274
there's no one history of cannibalism.

67
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:23,146
But we do know that people have 
been eating each other,

68
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,757
volunteering themselves to be eaten,

69
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:29,377
and accusing others of eating 
people for millennia.
