***Technologies used: Python (libraries: pysrt, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib*** | These were written for my master's project, "dynamic playback speed change based on one's eye movement" at McGill University.

## How it works?
- **cps_calculator_srt** converts .srt file to readable data format by Python and calculate each subtitle speed, which is CPS (Characters Per Seconds), and average CPS of a whole video.
- **cps_calculator_srt** visualize the result with a line graph
