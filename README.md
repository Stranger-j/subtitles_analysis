# subtitles_analysis
***Technologies used: Python (libraries: pysrt, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib *** | 

These were written for my master's project, "dynamic playback speed change based on one's eye movement" at McGill University.

## How it works?
- cps_calculator_srt converts .srt file to readable data format by Python and calculate each subtitle speed, which is CPS (Characters Per Seconds), and average CPS of a whole video.
- cps_calculator_srt visualize the result with a line graph
