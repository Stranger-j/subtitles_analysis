1
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:13,084
As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, 
one animal breaks the morning silence.

2
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:16,394
Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth,

3
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:22,613
these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks.

4
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:26,773
It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites

5
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,199
out of the seafloor.

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,630
But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,314
in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem.

8
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:40,490
Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae,

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,920
which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,060
and metamorphasize into coral polyps.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,780
Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,520
made of calcium carbonate.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,030
Together, colonies of polyps produce 
'large three-dimensional structures,

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,845
which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis.

15
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:03,335
These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies

16
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:06,301
that house and protect 
countless life forms.

17
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:10,585
Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor,

18
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:16,366
these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life.

19
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:22,262
Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators

20
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:24,922
between their trips foraging for seaweed.

21
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:29,234
As the primary food source for many 
of the reef’s fish and invertebrates,

22
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,684
seaweed is vital to this ecosystem.

23
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:35,084
But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic,

24
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,194
and even lethal to corals.

25
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:42,398
Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on,

26
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:46,658
and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding.

27
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:51,952
These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals,

28
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:54,142
including smothering and abrasion.

29
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:57,974
Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare—

30
00:01:57,974 --> 00:02:02,094
synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact.

31
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,257
This is where parrotfish come in.

32
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:08,344
Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed.

33
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:10,033
But unlike their neighbors,

34
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:14,762
parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed

35
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:16,207
from the ocean floor.

36
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:21,199
Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth

37
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,609
which can scrape and grind rock,

38
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:28,688
allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface.

39
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:32,428
This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume,

40
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:36,202
while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals

41
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:39,992
to settle and existing colonies to expand.

42
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:43,892
Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed.

43
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:46,252
Through a dynamic system 
of social networks,

44
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:50,564
parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish.

45
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:55,572
Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information

46
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:59,132
that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell.

47
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:03,172
They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors

48
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,682
using a special sensory organ.

49
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:09,692
All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish.

50
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:13,712
For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground

51
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:17,072
and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage.

52
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:21,905
Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning

53
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,935
that a threat is approaching.

54
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,742
By simply trying to stay alive,

55
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:29,612
these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive—

56
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:32,519
and more of these fish 
means less seaweed.

57
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,209
Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades

58
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,769
have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system.

59
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,189
In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish,

60
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,709
as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish.

61
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,434
This has led to unchecked seaweed growth,

62
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:54,879
which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs.

63
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,349
The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities.

64
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,259
Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network,

65
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,268
making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed.

66
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:10,722
Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses

67
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:13,482
while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth—

68
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:17,362
leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever.

69
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:21,482
Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life.

70
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:26,267
Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism,

71
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,157
sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research,

72
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:34,028
while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges.

73
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:37,348
Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species

74
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:41,478
like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies

75
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:44,129
for preserving these essential ecosystems.
